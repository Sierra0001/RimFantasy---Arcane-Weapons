# RimFantasy - Arcane Weapons

Some use magical gemstones to warm their homes.
Some use magical gemstones to light their paths.
Some use magical gemstones to craft deadly weapons.

Expensive to make as they are difficult to craft, many gemstones are spent during the refinement and enchantment process. The resulting weapons are infused with powerful magic and, in the hands of the right wielder can make them neigh unstoppable.

### Features

- 8 Arcane weapons (11 variants)
- 15 Weapon traits (3 variants each)

### Balance

Gems are intentionally sparse and not easy to obtain through natural means, but they can also be purchased from traders or obtained from salvaging certain objects.

Balance feedbacks are welcomed, please provide context when doing so.
